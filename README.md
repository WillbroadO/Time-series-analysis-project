Time series analysis with ARIMA model in python
Time series analysis is basically analyzing the data to find some pattern or trend over a certain period of time. After successfully analyzing the data, you have to forecast future trends/patterns. The nature of time series analysis is more identical to regression analysis, but here the data is time-dependent. In regression, it is assumed that the variables must be independent of each other. So, mere regression analysis can not be applied to time series data. You need different tools to do analysis.

In this project Python provides many libraries and APIs to work with time-series data. The most popular of them is the Statsmodels module. It provides almost all the classes and functions to work with time-series data. In this tutorial, we will use this module alongside other essential modules including NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib.
The following steps are involved:

* Understand the Components of Time Series before analysis
* Import Time Series Data in Python
* Visualize Time Series Data in Python
* What is Stationarity in Time Series?
* Make a Time Series Stationary in Python
* Build Time Series Models in Python
* Determine the Order of the ARIMA Model
* Apply ARIMA Model in Python
